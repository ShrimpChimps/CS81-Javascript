alert("Hello");
var alert = 2;
alert("World");

The first and third lines of code are statements that alert the string "Hello" and "World". The second statement assigns the variable alert to 2.
However, when the script is run, no alerts occur. This occurs because the second line is overwriting the alert function (since a function is an object)
and replacing it with the number 2. This explains why the alert in the third line of code is not called, because the alert function has been overwritten.
The reason the first alert is not called is that alert is a local variable in the script, thus the variable is initialized immediately upon execution of the
script and assigned with the value of undefined. Again, the alert function is overwritten, thus the first alert does not run either.
