(a)

The expression new Date() produces a Date object that stores the current date and time.
Using an alert to display the date object gives, for example:
"Tue Jul 12 2016 23:07:11 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)"

(b)
A date object for 1/20/2009 at midnight. Using an alert displays:
"Tue Jan 20 2009 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)"

The arguments passed in to the function, in order, are the year, month (counted from 0-11, so January
is 0 and December is 11), and day.

(c)
A date object is calculated as the number of milliseconds from 1/1/1970 at midnight. The function
Date.valueOf() returns the number stored in the Date object. Therefore, the expression
d1. valueOf() - d2. valueOf() returns the number of milliseconds between the two date values.
