var shout = function(){
   var message = "HEY YOU";
   alert(message);
};
shout();
alert(message);


In the first four lines, the variable shout is initialized as a function. The first line of the function declares
a local variable message with the value "HEY YOU". The second line of the function calls the alert function, passing
the variable message.

When the code is run, the shout() function is called (line 5). The shout() function runs as described above, properly
alerting "HEY YOU". Then line 6 is run, which throws a ReferenceError: The variable message is not defined. This occurs
because the message variable is declared inside the function shout(), making it a local variable. Since it only has a
local scope, it is only defined in that function. Therefore, when line 6 is called, which is outside the function, the
variable is considered undeclared.
