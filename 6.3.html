(a)

Besides the <button> HTML tags, text is added in between the button tags. This text is what is displayed on
the button when the page is loaded. On the input tag, this was the purpose of the value attribute.

(b)

The main difference is that the button tags allow you to add HTML between them, while the input tag only allows
you to add text to the value attribute. The button tags allow for more varied ways to display not only text on the
button but also images and any other HTML elements on it. However, this feature is not supported in IE6 and earlier,
so the button may not be useable for those using an older browser.
